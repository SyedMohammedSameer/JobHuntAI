---

#### 3. ✅ Security Enhancements
**Implemented Security Measures:**

1. **Helmet.js** - HTTP security headers ✅
   - Already configured in server.ts

2. **MongoDB Sanitization** ✅
   - `express-mongo-sanitize` added
   - Prevents NoSQL injection attacks
   - Sanitizes user input in req.body, req.query, req.params

3. **Rate Limiting** ✅
   - Already configured (100 requests/minute)
   - Applied to all `/api/*` routes

4. **CORS Configuration** ✅
   - Restricted to FRONTEND_URL only
   - Credentials enabled
   - Specific methods and headers allowed

5. **Input Validation** ✅
   - `express-validator` already in use
   - Auth endpoints validated

6. **Password Security** ✅
   - bcrypt with 12 rounds (strong hashing)
   - Password field excluded from default queries

7. **JWT Security** ✅
   - Short-lived access tokens (15 min)
   - Refresh token rotation (7 days)
   - Strong secrets required

8. **File Upload Security** ✅
   - File type validation (PDF/DOCX only)
   - File size limits (5MB max)
   - Multer error handling

**Security Audit Results:**
- ✅ Backend: 0 vulnerabilities (2 moderate issues fixed)
- ✅ Frontend: 0 vulnerabilities
- ✅ Dependencies up to date

---

#### 4. ✅ Performance Optimizations

**Backend:**
1. **Compression** ✅
   - Response compression enabled
   - Reduces bandwidth usage
   - Faster API responses

2. **Database Indexes** ✅
   - User model: email, subscription fields, visa data, email preferences
   - Application model: userId, jobId, status, appliedDate
   - Compound indexes for common queries
   - Optimized for email notification queries

3. **Connection Pooling** ✅
   - MongoDB connection pooling (default Mongoose settings)

4. **Caching Strategy** ⏳
   - Recommended: Add Redis for API response caching
   - Job search results could be cached

**Frontend:**
- ⏳ Code splitting (pending frontend structure)
- ⏳ Lazy loading routes
- ⏳ Image optimization
- ⏳ Bundle analysis

---

#### 5. ✅ Production Configuration

**Backend Environment:**
- ✅ `backend/.env.production.example` created
- ✅ All required variables documented
- ✅ Strong secret generation instructions
- ✅ Live Stripe keys noted

**Deployment Configuration:**
- ✅ Comprehensive deployment guide (DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
- ✅ Railway setup instructions
- ✅ MongoDB Atlas configuration
- ✅ SendGrid setup guide
- ✅ Sentry project creation
- ✅ Stripe webhook configuration
- ⏳ Netlify configuration (pending frontend structure)
